      <h2>Introduction:</h2>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>
      Study of inanimate objects being the discourse of science naturally carries the question about existence of animate things in perception. It is just what's there in physical existence, that constitute the mind and cognition, although the instantaneous reality can have utter variances among individual minds, simply the fact that perception cannot be embodied in a finite state computation, distinguishes the spectrum of its complexity, than that of inanimate ones. For long literature and philosophy has jargoned about mind endlessly, each speculating their own possibilities to tie up reality and perception, but only have hindered the progress of scientific analysis of causation and perception; along which direction, resides the theory of thought, mind and all those that were seemingly metaphysical for thousands of years and maybe information theory can tell us something novel here. Although empirical evidence enforces the monic physical realism unlike solipsism, but at the same time the instantaneous realisation of subjectivity in one conscious body exerts its own truth value. 
    </p>

    <p>In analysing matters that previously weren't considered natural, like acquisition of information, synthesis of so, and extrapolation of knowledge, or let along perceiving an internal thought or external object - in terms of analytical and scientific paradigm, one requires to consider the wide range of possibilities from simple [fundamental bodies are simplest by virtue of their lack of  internal structures - [1] proposition 2.02] quantum observation and acquisition of information to the phenomena in much higher complexity level - subjective observations of seemingly classical continuum. It appears that the complexity levels might enemerge [ = cause to emerge] wholly different sets of properties to characterise the objects, but to ensure our trajectory it is straightforward that a process like the <b>act of observation</b> is common to both the spectrum, concluding a general structure of the process itself, apart from the description of complexity level it is acting upon. A thorough contemplation yields a much richer structure between observation, knowledge and logic, based on which every possible understanding takes place in cognition, and that logical structuralisation of an entity in perception, in terms of language, has a very close relation with observability. </p>

    <p>
      <b>[ PoSR ]  Principle of Sufficient Reason</b> : <u>If it is true, then there should necessarily be sufficient reason behind why it is the case and not anything else </u>
    </p>


    <p>
      One extreme subtlety we don't discuss often, yet extremely use it always, is the idea that - if it is true then it should be so, or that if it is true, it is necessarily so; and, 'therefore there must be sufficient reason behind why it is the case and not anything else'. this is true for every phenomenon that totalizes nature. Isn't that what natural science does when new observations are made from unknown causes? They consider - since it is naturally (given the constraints of observation {apparatus arrangement}) the case, and not anything else - an invariant state that is an invariant to “causation operator” - there must be a reason behind so. It's nothing but scientific investigation, which has at its heart the assumption of PoSR. 
    </p>


    <p>
      To know is to observe, and to understand is to know - this necessary part of the process of understanding that gives a tiny complex blob of mass, the ability to comprehend what's in there in the universe, i.e. the ability to make sense and not just nonsense [ it should be clear that sense is contained in language, by this I mean an arbitrary wild or natural sound isn't a sense, since there isn't any equivalence between what it means to what can be said - we can use language because we've been able to establish such an equivalence, that is to say - “<b>…and whatever a man knows, whatever is not mere rumbling and roaring that he has heard, can be said in three words.</b>” - [1] - Kurnberger - but 'wind is blowing with 63 decible sound in my sensor' is a sense, since you've placed it in a framework where sense is possible, and in doing so you've represented the senseless sound of blowing wind into some meaningful measurement. ], in this entirety of the cosmos, is actually very questionable. HOW COME EXACTLY? We can see consciousness exists and everything, starting from science, human knowledge, society… all such constructions exist - now use PoSR - what's the sufficient reason behind why this is the case and not anything else?

    </div>
    


    <p>
    
      Some dualities are omni-persistent, quite innate to the structure of existence itself. Literature has a few names for them like Subjective experience-/-objective reality, mind-/-matter, phenomenon-/-noumenon and likewise. What they wish to capture is essentially the distinction between <b>what is the case</b> and <b>what can be the case</b>. The later one is in the logical space of the observer, who pictures all other possibilities that give the same observation - is the reality, whereas the former, where one physical realisation has taken place, is the actual event. <b>Reality is a representation of this actuality</b>, without which whatever actually happens (in nature) wouldn’t make any sense afterall. At the same time, individual minds are perceiving their internal and external environment [Internal Environment is like the psychological state of one mind, but with rather measurable attributes
      ] always, and some representations are impossible in actuality. By this I consider the entirety of possibilities that human mind can represent, has certain constructions that aren’t actually true [a subjective dream, any such object that is indecomposable to atoms, yet exists in the form of a representation ]. Therefore,

    </p>


    <p>
      
      <b>Actuality</b>: The truth behind the process (complete information of its trajectory in hilbert space)</p>
<p><b>Reality</b>:    The truth about the process (macroscopic sense - classical correlations)<p>
At the same time any fundamental matter functions in a very peculiar way when an observer intervenes in the path of its evolution - it freaking changes to a state that is invariant to the operation of “being found out” {The state <b>collapses</b> into any eigenvalue of operator, which <b>represents</b> the observation}  [2], i.e. in the Copenhagenian term - collapses or in Everettian term - branche. But now just use <b>PoSR</b>>, why does it act like that? and who is that observer? 
    </p>


    <p>
      Unfortunately only the later has a satisfactory answer but not the former. W. Zurek [2] says, an observer can be anything that interacts, anything that can accept, or give-off force carriers like photons. Just as a molecule can observe another one, due to the variance in the charge density, wrapping electromagnetic fields inside a chemical solution, or a planet can observe distant black-hole merge due to gravitational waves that periodically distorts its shape; likewise a subjective being observes its unconscious responses in a dream, or observes a semantic form (meaning) by understanding it. Clearly an observer from theoretical science seems to have a close connection with consciousness as a subjective observer (such as those of an inanimate observer but with origin from much different complexity level), and we can extend the spectrum of observability to even subjective ones, and attempt in answering - PoSR behind emergence of subject and consciousness. From now on the observer can be anything and we can see clearly, consciousness is strongly correlated to this whole business of understanding and making sense out of arbitrariness. 

    </p>


    <p>
      But attempting to answer about the specialty of observation, the former question, i.e. why does it act like that, when observed a very sensitive system; it becomes rather unclear, since the nature of observation seemed to have been hidden under the rug by philosophers and interpreters of quantum mechanics. 
I'd rather consider, since observation seems fundamental to things that exist, there should be sufficient reason behind why necessarily it is the case, just usual PoSR we've been discussing.

    <br>
    <p>
      Recent developments by considering observers themselves to be open systems, interacting with a huge environment where the object under observation also is immersed; one can show that the perception of classical correlation and repeatable observables emerge due to a process called Einselection [Environment Induced Selection] [2], which selects out possible states (pointer states) which are fittest under the action of observation, and once one act of observation takes place, it falls one of its pointer states. Zurek [2] names this phenomenon as quantum darwinism, where pointer states are chosen by the constraints of the environment, and observation collapses the system to one of such states. In fact one can derive the Born's Rule[ Born’s Rule is a foundation in quantum theory, which states - the dynamic quantity one deals with in quantum theory, the wavefunction - gives the probability of that event to take place, when mod-squared  ] from the postulates in the theory of decoherence [2]. 

    </p>

    <p>
      Considering the same description, the perception of classical realism is due to our representation of extrinsic information, while an intrinsic entity is solely due to the virtue of the mind itself, talking about which one must tend towards Tononi-Chalmers-Tegmark's Integrated Information Theory of Consciousness.

      <h2>“The Great Divide of Being”, measures and Integrated Information Theory of Consciousness:  </h2>
    </div>

    <p>
      Understanding a thing at its fundamentals is being able to measure it, or rather formalise a proper measure, suitable for quantities of that thing. Who wondered if a species would invent natural numbers, let alone quaternions, which are nothing but measurement of countability and its higher-dimensional generalisation. Likewise we have been able to suitably assign measure to kinematics of inanimate matters, since they involve simple quantities like length, mass and charges, but following the idea of P. Anderson's more is different, how can we expect much more complex structures to have only such measures as its fundamental constituents, rather its suitable to think of them having different quantities, which are yet unmeasurable. But phenomenological experience, just as Newton or Kepler did about celestial mechanics, led Neuroscientist Julio Tononi, Physicist Max Tegmark and Philosopher David Chalmers to devise a theory to measure consciousness. In fact they did with few assumptions like Cause-Effect Power, Empiricism and Emergentism, and showed consciousness to be an intrinsic entity to the subject and put forward a measure of intrinsic-information content of a complex system, or somewhat of a measure of complexity - Φ [Phi] -  as the measure of consciousness. But for that, one requires to classify what requires  what it takes for something to exist as an <u>intrinsic entity</u>. 

    </p>


    <p align="left">
      <ul>
        <li><b>Intrinsic Existence</b> - Cause-effect power that is intrinsic - Something can exist only if it has certain cause-effect power - “Crucially, something can be said to exist from its own intrinsic perspective - for itself, independent of external observers - only if it has cause-effect power intrinsically, that is, within itself” - [3] 
        </li>
        <li><b>Compositionality</b> - It can be said to be composed of its parts only if those parts exerts cause-effect power over the whole </li>
        <li><b>Informational</b> - State of such system requires to be specific to carry out informational measurements
        </li>
        <li><b>Integration</b> - Cause-effect power is such that it is irreducible - the transformation of information within the subparts cannot be separated from the whole without destroying the overall structure - i.e. the measure cannot be further factored into subparts and the difference that the whole-ness makes than the sum of its parts - gives the integrated information in this intrinsical environment (inside cognition). 
        </li>
        <li><b>Exclusion</b> - Cause-effect power that is maximally irreducible - “From the intrinsic perspective, something can only exist as an entity if it has definite borders and spatio-temporal grain” - [3] - which can find its origin in Carl Friston's Markov Blanket formalism of consciousness. </li>
      </ul>  
    </p>


    <p>Such requirements - being a global maximum of irreducible, specific, structured, intrinsic cause-effect power - must be met for something to strictly exist as an intrinsic entity - one that exists for itself - as a “subject” of existence. To quote from the author </p>
    
    <br>
    <br>

  <p><b>“For something to exist extrinsically, instead, it is sufficient to have cause-effect power externally  -  on something outside. According to IIT, the distinction between existence as an intrinsic entity and any lesser kind of physical existence constitutes the “great divide of being.” And a great divide it is, because it is the same divide as that between consciousness and unconsciousness: since the requirements for being an intrinsic entity are exactly the same as those for supporting experience, it follows that being an intrinsic entity, properly defined, is one and the same thing as being conscious."</b></p>

      Clearly it seems a clear and suitable definition of measure, corresponding intrinsic attributes are necessary in    
      order to understand that which differs a Conscious observer and a non-conscious one, and this will further guide us to distinguish between a thing and a being.

    <p>The current text is concerned with providing a basis of observation in terms of empirical knowledge as well as apriori analytical knowledge, thus providing an axiomatic viewpoint of what observation entails from the fundamental interactions to the process of understanding and picturing the world as we intend. In the following a set of elementary propositions will be laid flat, of whose elaboration, can be found just correspondingly afterwards : </p>
  
  
  <div>
    <ol>
      <li> <b>Apriority of Existence : If it is, it exists; and it is a thing {PoAE -</b> Proposition of Apriority of Existence <b>} </b>
        <p>[Although fundamental objects are to be classified based on what it does, i.e. its essence, given certain constraints; a conscious entity or a subject cannot be classified by an a priori universality or essence, rather for an existing being - existence precedes essence [ l'existence précède l'essence - Jean-Paul Sartre], which can as well be extended to substances, of unknown or known essence - though the existence can be solely fictitious in the subject's exotic reality, and even in that case it must be considered a real thing, in the same sense that your dream appears to you as real to you as a chair or an electron]</p></li>

        <li> <b>Perception is a co-measurement {PoCM -</b> Proposition of Co-Measurement <b>} </b>
          <p>[Intrinsic measurement that yields a distribution of correlations is a co-measurement -  a phenomenon that is structurally similar to measurement but isn’t exactly so, co-measurement assigns cause-effect structure to intrinsic information, by which I mean to assign apriori causal correlations to a phenomenon, by logically recreating it in some form (analytically in theory or approximately in simulations), or just extrapolating sense from some perception, eg. to seek the structure in trees from its picture is to correlate between the patterns of its branches (subparts), and this is this act of co-measurement. One can understand this by integration of information from several modalities in our body, i.e. visual, auditory, olfactory and all such sensory modalities capture external correlations, which in turn integrates, into the perception (see Fig 1) The key distinction between measurement and co-measurement is that the former detects correlation and the later assigns correlation, so where a measurement results a quantity, a co-measurement results in a correlated-integration of the constituents. Note that, both are acts of observation,one yielding a distribution of correlations and other yielding a numerically representable quantity]
          </p></li>

          <li> <b>Specificity of Information : Correlations are all there is {PoSI - </b> Prop. of Specificity of Information <b>} </b>
            <p>[A sceptic can always question the standardization we calibrate our measurements to, i.e. an electron charges -1.603x10^-19 times what is known to be 1 coulomb. We see information is represented in terms of relative measures with respect to some standardization - and this statement is standard-insensitive. In fact what we acquire empirically or analytically are the relations between several components, could be internal to the object or via some interaction with the environment, which is nothing but how it is correlated with respect to its constraints, likely in a visual mode of perception - the constituents that make up the external entirety, are represented in the logical space within consciousness, and so we see humans with certain anatomical structure, or trees with certain class of shapes and not something drastically different than so - therefore it is just the correlation that is propagated throughout neuronal channel that recreates what's outside, inside the intrinsic environment]
            </p></li>
            
            <li> <b>Quantifiability: Observation yields quantity {PoQ :</b> Proposition of Quantifiability <b>} </b>
              <p>[By now we have distinct types of observation, classified for different products - A. extrinsic observation, involving actual bodies, are necessary to have numerical representation to its quantity, B. Intrinsic observation, involving exotic subjective modalities, are to be quantified with meaning and these are semantic quantities. Note that a measurable or co-measurable quantity can be a numerically or semantically representable quantity, and in fact <b>co-measurement includes measurement</b> by assuring that semantic form of expression supports numerical representations within them. Therefore the co-measurement seems fundamental but slightly metaphysical, although the measurement has always been crudely physical. With this classification here we distinguish between several kinds of quantities and measurables - numerical quantities and semantic quantities]

            <ol type="i">
              <li><b>Object under observation must have at least one measurable attribute
              </b><p>[ i.e. the object must have some quantifiable attribute or that the observer must have at least one representation to quantify an attribute of the object. Consider, an expression “the bowl is glowing with temperature 720 deg celsius” - here a picture is conveyed where the picture itself carries the semantic measure of a phenomenon, that something was radiating with a numerically measured value a measurable attribute, i.e. temperature (here). This expression clears the distinction between co-measurement–measurement and numerical–semantic quantity]</p></li>
            
             <li><b>At least one universal definition of a measure is accepted
            </b><p>[For measuring an attribute, i.e. constructing a definition to assign each of its subsets a unique value from the non-negative bounded reals, one must agree to one definition. Instead co-measurement is free of definition and thus subjects picture differently, every expression by virtue of their corresponding subjective response. This similar procedure is adapted in the formulation of Integrated information theory of consciousness by Tononi-Tegmark-Masafumi]</p></li>

            <li> <b>Structural Representation : A valid expression in universal grammar is a fact  {PoSR -</b> Proposition of Structural Representation <b>} </b>
              <p>[truth of an expression in a logical system, requires an algorithm (deterministic of Halting or indeterminable or non-halting) to validate its truth of falsity in binary result, therefore in this postulation, an expression will be considered to be valid if it is permitted in universal grammar. To quote from a linguist of Chomsky index 1(  ) - “To begin with, the term Universal Grammar (UG) is nothing but a label for the striking difference in cognitive capacity between “us and them”, i.e., humans versus the 21 rest of animal species ” - Angel J. Gallego. Likewise a semantic quantity that has quantitative value within perception, can be physically realised by logically representing the meaning into a syntagma. Note that, at this point, there can very easily arise a debate about whether we can represent a meaning solely into syntax - of whose answer can be the following. <b>Meaning of an expressn is what that should be a logical reference of, and that solely should depend on the constructor/user of the syntagma.</b> Therefore the physical realisation of an expression, are in terms of syntagmas, where patterns of words and letters are supposed to represent an underlying sense that has nothing to do with each of the letters or words, but only their overall arrangement [4].

            <ol type="i">

              <li><b> A fact is a representation of a picture</b><p>[ In the introduction of Tractatus Logico Philosophicus, by Bertrand Russel, one finds - “In order that a certain sentence should assert a certain fact, there must, however the language may be constructed, be something in common between the structure of the sentence and the structure of the fact. This is perhaps the most fundamental thesis of Mr. Wittgenstein’s theory”; besides Proposition 2.1 from [1] “Wir machen uns Bilder der Tatsachen” -> “We picture facts to ourselves”, and just afterwards - Prop. 2.12 - “Das Bild ist ein Modell der Wirklichkeit” -> A picture is a model of reality, and that precisely is the functionality of language - This portion is straightforwardly adapted from Wittgenstein’s structuralisation]</p></li>
              <li><b>A picture depicts a truth</b><p>[Prop 2.131 + Prop 2.141 + Prop 2.1513 from [1] => “ In a picture the elements of the picture are the representatives of objects” + “A Picture is a fact” + ”So a picture, conceived in this way, also includes the pictorial relationship, which makes it into a picture” - indicates picturing is modelling actuality, therefore validating truths that are actual in existence]</p></li>
              <li><b> Facts totalize the possibilities </b><p>[Simply the consequence of “what can be sad can be said clearly”, that possibilities of observations totalize the possibilities of events, therefore their representations must totalize language, note that there cannot be a possibility which cannot be quantified semantically, that would violate Chomsky’s observation of Wilhelm von Humboldt's phrase that language is - infinite use of finite means. Therefore, it a thing is possible, it must have a fact representing that picture of possibility]

Even though it might seem knowledge is infinite and boundless, analytic treatment of language says that it is not, and bounded by the spectrum of possibilities. Yet containing vast possibilities, it must afterwards be a finitely measurable quantity. In the Modal Logic, first identified by Aristotle in his De Interpretatione or Organon, that Possibility and Necessity (the foundational modes in modal logic) are interchangable in the sense that - “p is possible” is equivalent to “~p is not necessary”, that is, “it is never necessary that ~p is the case” which in turn means “p is possibly the case”. In this way, the possibility is totalized by the range of its necessity, and beyond which it cannot necessarily be the case and thus becomes impossible. This in turn further strengthens how “what is possibly the case”, that which is observable in reality (representational) constructs knowledge, and what’s impossible then is what falls outside the boundary of necessities]

      Noam Chomsky in his 1993 paper A minimalist program for linguistic theory introduced a syntactic-structural formalisation of the idea MERGE, where two syntagma combines (coarse grains) into one, i.e. two syntagma merges into one. He managed to show that such an act of MERGE is ubiquitous in all forms of language, and therefore not at all specific to language rather general to universal grammar itself. Later on in a paper [4], Physicist Roman Orus and Linguist Angel J. Gallego, both from Spain formalised this idea in terms of (Syntactic) Tensor Networks, where the MERGE operation as been formalised to take two inputs and give off an output, i.e. MERGE: X, Y → Q . In the diagram beside, δ = M[1]{α, β} and μ = M[2]{γ, δ}. Likewise given a syntagma, one can construct a tensor network tree, representing syntactic decomposition of the expression, and it can be understood as renormalisation of information at each scale of MERGing operation, i.e. once each MERGE takes place we wash away redundant degrees of freedom, and deal with renormalised (MERGEd) information only. Work on comparative cognition has endorsed the insight that -

    <b>“Only humans appear to possess a mental grammar - an “I-Language” where “I” stands for Intentional, Internal and Individual - that allows us to create infinitely many meaningful expressions from a finite stock of discrete units … However, the knowledge of such fundamental rules (the so called reductionism) does not imply a priori the knowledge of the emergent laws for aggregates of many fundamental entities (the so-called emergentism) ”	</b>

    <p>Therefore like scale-transformation of statistical mechanics, MERGE in linguistics entails Information-renormalization in physics. A coarse-graining of information means the removal of superfluous degrees of freedom in order to describe a given physical system at a different (coarse-grained) scale. Combined with rescaling, it is the procedure entailing renormalization by which the rules describing the macroscopic equation emerge from those describing the microscopic. Chomsky’s MERGE operation entails the renormalization of syntactic information, moreover the renormalization accounts for different time-scales. i.e. 
      M{[V eat], [N pasta]] = [VP [V eat] [N pasta]], {formal example of MERGing two syntagmas}. A Tree decomposition representing information information renormalization is vivid in the figure beside: 
      The sense extrapolated from the expression - “the man from Boston drives well the car” resides at the topmost renormalised scale (z4 here), likewise in exactly similar formal procedure one extracts essence from a paragraph by considering each of its sentences each leaf nodes, and likewise for a chapter, its paragraphs are the leaf nodes, and upto the furthest point, the whole semantic sense of a text can be extrapolated by quantifying a Semantic Tensor Network like syntactic one described in [4]. Indeed without reduction of superfluous degrees of freedom, it would be unbearably difficult to go through any form in language, let alone long text, and that we can do it after all, is due to the structure of language itself - which renormalizes information by virtue of its usage.

    <h2>Conclusion :    </h2>
  </div>
  <p>This monograph is dedicated to closely analyse the the role of identifying and functionally demystifying Subject as nothing but an intrinsic observer, where in addition to usual measurement of external agency, it has capability to co-measure what’s intrinsic to itself, and therefore identify consciousness from inanimate objects that are only capable of extrinsic observations. Besides the logic in language along with representation of picture as facts, are made clear in this paradigm of a description of observation that holds both for subjects of extreme high internal complexity to objects of identically no complexity within whatsoever (structure with no further decomposable structure). </p>
<br>
<p>Targeting the rudimentary symmetry might ease the task of explaining a phenomenon upto great certainty for a wide range of complexity levels. In this case, the knowledge yielded by observation carries the structure of the symmetry that prevails from atomic observation to subjective observation, only that its form and manifestation change only, not the content. Such a formalisation holding for this wide range of complexity is a non-trivial task although much richer formalization is possible and will be the next task, to polish it into a theory of observation.
